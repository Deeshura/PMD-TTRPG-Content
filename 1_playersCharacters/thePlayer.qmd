# The Role of the Players

The primary responsibility of the players is to take control of a Player Character, making decisions that would be appropriate for your characters personality, with the overall goal of overcoming the challenges set by the Game Master in order to achieve your characters goals.

Before a campaign begins, each player should sit down and create their character. This involves both narrative elements, such as creating a history, personality, and goals for their character to accomplish, as well as rules-driven elements like choosing your character's type, species, archetype, and more.

Furthermore, it is the responsiblity of the players to respect the choices of the GM, and the effort that they put into managing the table and the narrative. The players and the GM are not always adversaries- rather, they are working together in order to tell a fulfilling story and have fun. Play in good faith, and strive to co-operate, rather than compete.
